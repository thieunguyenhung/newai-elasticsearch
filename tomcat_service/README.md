```shell
cd /home/workspace/
git clone https://github.com/thieunguyenhung/newai-elasticsearch.git
```
- Copy WAR file to Tomcat webapps folder
```shell
cp /home/workspace/newai-elasticsearch/tomcat_service/newai-spelling-api.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
```

### Sending a request to service
- Send a POST request with JSON body
```shell
{
    "text":"[Text need to check]"
}
```
- Remember to add Authorization field in the request header with username:password (must be encoded by Base64) that matches with string in *auth_string.txt*

Note
-------------
- You can change authentication string in */usr/local/tomcat/webapps/newai-spelling-api/conf/auth_string.txt*
- URL to connect to Elastic search server in */usr/local/tomcat/webapps/newai-spelling-api/conf/elasticsearch_url.txt*. In case you want to edit this file, remember just only one line, **NO** new-line or end-line is allowed. Use the below command to edit the file without unexpected new-line
```shell

```
